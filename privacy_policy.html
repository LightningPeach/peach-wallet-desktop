d.  Lightning_id / Public key of your wallet (unique identifier of lightning node in lightning network in hex representation), is only kept for the duration of one session while your wallet is online.

<strong>2. How we collect your data</strong>
Most of the personal data we process is information that you knowingly provide to us directly, while using the Software.

<strong>3. The purposes for which your data are used</strong>
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal data for the following main purposes:

a.  To provide our services

When you provide the IP address and Public Key, we process them to route streaming payments, and payments via Public Key that are initiated by the sender without a corresponding recipient payment request. Transaction information is only used to route messages between wallet users if there is no payment request from the recipient. If the recipient does send a payment request, the server does not participate in this exchange at all and the information is not shared.

Such anonymized information may include:
•	 Device type

We may be required by law to collect and share personal information provided by you with public or governmental organizations for the purpose of compliance with the law, a court order, or to respond to any government or regulatory request.

<strong>4. Legal basis</strong>
We collect, use and store your personal data to provide services to you, to comply with the legal obligations we are subject to, if necessary, for our legitimate interests or on the basis of your consent.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions in relation to the processing for which you provided your consent, by adjusting your settings (if available) or by contacting us (please see par. <strong>‘Your Rights’</strong> below).

When we process your personal data for our legitimate interests, we are balancing these interests against your legitimate interests. Where necessary we have taken appropriate measures to limit implications and prevent unwarranted harm to you. Our legitimate interests may for example include security and safety purposes, improving the Software or to provide better services and offers to you. For more information on these interests, please see the purposes for which we process your personal data above. More information on the balancing tests we perform is available upon request. Where we process your personal data for our legitimate interests, you have the right to object at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation (please see par. <strong>‘Your Rights’</strong> below).

Where we process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which we collected it initially (and we rely on a legal basis other than consent or complying with legal obligations for this new purpose), we will ascertain whether processing for this new purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data were initially collected. More information on this assessment is available upon request (please see par. <strong>‘Your Rights’</strong> below).

<strong>5. Information sharing</strong>
We may share personal data that we collect in order to provide and improve our service and the Software with our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. These third parties are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal data confidential and may only use information about you to perform services on our behalf that are related to the Software, except to the extent that they are required to do so by law or in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. All such third parties will be required to adequately safeguard your personal data, subject to agreements that correspond to the requirements of applicable laws.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a user name, password and private key for access to the Software, you are responsible for keeping these credentials confidential. We ask you not to share your credentials with anyone.
Your personal data will be stored no longer than is necessary for the purpose they were obtained for, our compliance with legal and fiscal obligations, or for solving any disputes but not longer than 6 (six) years.

<strong>7. International data transfers</strong>
The collected data may be transferred to trusted third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area, including Canada, USA, Ukraine, Georgia, for the purposes mentioned above. We will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under applicable data protection law and regulations.

<strong>8. Your Rights</strong>
Providing the required data is necessary for you to use the Software. If you do not wish to provide the required data, you cannot use the Software. When you use the Software, and provide the required data, you can contact us (please see paragraph 11 below) to exercise any of the rights you are granted under applicable data protection laws, which includes (1) the right to access your data, (2) to rectify them, (3) to erase them, (4) to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to receiving a file of your personal data and (6) or the right to object to the processing, and where we have asked for your consent, to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations. We may, for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided by you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract.
When you would like to exercise your rights, please send your request to the contact details in Paragraph 11 below. Please note that we may need you to provide additional information to confirm your identity. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority or the supervisory authority in the EU member state of your habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of your rights regarding your personal data.
You can also contact us at if you have any questions, remarks or complaints in relation to this privacy notice.

<u>1. Right to access</u>
You may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if so, receive access to that data in the form of a copy. When complying with an access request, we will also provide you with additional information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned as well as any other information necessary for you to exercise the essence of this right.

<u>2. Right to rectification</u>
You have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or incompleteness. Upon request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.

<u>3. Right to erasure</u>
You also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the deletion of your data by us and, where possible, any other controller to whom your data has previously been made public by us.  Erasure of your personal data only finds place in certain cases, prescribed by law and listed under article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for which they were processed as well as situations where they were processed unlawfully. Due to the way we maintain certain services, it may take some time before backup copies are erased.

<u>4. Right to restriction of processing</u>
You have the right to obtain the restriction of the processing of your personal data, which means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was contested but some time is needed for us to verify their (in) accuracy. This right does not prevent us from continue storing your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.

<u>5. Right to receive a file (data portability)</u>
Your right to data portability entails that you may request us to provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly to another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where this is technically feasible we will transmit your personal data directly to the other controller.

<u>6. Right to object</u>
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which means you may request us to no longer process your personal data. This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’ ground constitutes the legal basis for processing (see par. ‘Legal basis’ above).
At any time and free of charge you can object to direct marketing purposes in case your personal data are processed for such purposes, which includes profiling purposes to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. In case you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
