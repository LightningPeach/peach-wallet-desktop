This notice describes how Bitfury Holding BV processes your personal data in the context of the Peach Wallet Software (the &quot;Software&quot; or the &quot;Wallet&quot;) including all its services and functions. The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot; refer to Bitfury Holding BV. For more information on our contact details see paragraph "10. Contacting Us". We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our Software users. Therefore, we encourage you to read this notice carefully.

<strong>1. What information do we collect?</strong>
There are two privacy modes available in the Software: Extended and Standard. In the Software, we provide a switch toggle which allows a user to switch between the two modes. The Extended mode introduces additional features but requires minimal interaction with Peach servers to work. Standard mode excludes any communication with external servers at the expense of the following three features being disabled: Recurring/Stream payments, Payments without a user-generated Lightning invoice, and Contacts. The privacy mode can be changed anytime within the Profile screen of the Wallet.

If Standard mode is activated, we do not collect or process any personal information about the wallet and its usage. In other words, the Software does not connect or interact with any Peach servers at any moment in this mode. A privacy mode choice is offered to a user during the first run of the Wallet and is made available as a setting in the Software.

If the Extended mode is activated, we process the following personal data:
(a)  Transaction information (sender’s and receiver’s public keys) is transmitted from your wallet to the Peach server when a recurring/stream payment or a payment through Lightning_id (public key) is initiated (invoice less payments). This data is never stored, and the Peach server only routes this data to the payment recipient. The transaction is end-to-end encrypted on the wallet side and the Peach server does not have access to any data except from where from and where to the payment needs to be routed.
(b)  Your IP address, which we automatically receive and record when you interact with our server, is only kept for the duration the wallet is online and Standard mode is switched off.
(c)  Lightning_id known as the Public key of your wallet (unique identifier of lightning node in the lightning network in hex representation), is received by the Peach server only when the wallet user interacts with one of the three additional features of the Extended mode (see paragraph 1). This data is only kept for the duration the wallet is online and Standard mode is switched off.
The information above is collected with the sole purpose of allowing the Extended mode functionality to the user.
By clicking the optional consent button, you allow collecting anonymized usage statistics via Google Analytics and Firebase. Please note, that we collect this data even in Standard mode but only if you have explicitly opted in for us to do so during the Wallet setup. This process does not interact with our servers and does not provide any personal data. The information we process here is fully anonymized and could not be used to track down a particular person or device.

We do <u>NOT</u> collect, nor have access to, the following information:
(a)  Your private keys from cryptocurrencies; these are only accessible through your own device; and
(b)  information on the transactions you perform through the using of the Software.

<strong>2. How we collect your data</strong>
All the data we process is information that you knowingly provide to us directly while using the Software. We try to provide explicit in-app descriptions of what data we use and for what purpose, but in if you have more questions please don’t hesitate to ask us on <a href="mailto:privacy@lightningpeach.com">privacy@lightningpeach.com</a>.
If the Standard mode is activated, no personal data is ever processed or even accessible to us.

<strong>3. The purposes for which your data are used</strong>
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal data for the following main purposes:

(a)  To provide our services

When you provide the IP address and Public Key, we process them to only route recurring/stream payments, and payments via ligthning_id (public key) that are initiated by the sender without a corresponding recipient payment request. Transaction information is only used to route messages between wallet users if there is no payment request from the recipient. If the recipient does send a payment request, the Peach server does not even participate in this exchange at all, and no information is shared.

(b)  For statistical research

General. Subject to your consent, we use automatic tools like Google Analytics and Firebase to perform anonymized statistical research into general trends regarding the use of our services.

Such anonymized information may include the following statistics:
&bull;	 Device type
&bull;	 Button clicks
&bull;	 Screen openings
&bull;	 Session duration
&bull;	 Geographic location

Interests and benefits. Statistical research helps us to develop better services and offerings, to improve the design and content of our Software.

c.  To comply with statutory obligations

We may be required by law to collect and share personal information provided by you with public or governmental organizations for the purpose of compliance with the law, a court order, or to respond to any government or regulatory request.

<strong>4. Legal basis</strong>
We collect, use and store your personal data to provide services to you, to comply with the legal obligations we are subject to, if necessary, for our legitimate interests or on the basis of your consent.
You may withdraw your consent to anonymized app usage statistics processing at any time by adjusting settings in the Profile section of the Wallet.
When we process your personal data, limited to your IP address and Lightning ID, for our legitimate interests, we are balancing these interests against your legitimate interests. Where necessary we have taken appropriate measures to limit implications and prevent unwarranted harm to you. Our legitimate interests may for example include security and safety purposes, improving the Software or to provide better services and offers to you. For more information on these interests, please see the purposes for which we process your personal data above. More information on the balancing tests we perform is available upon request. Where we process your personal data for our legitimate interests, you have the right to object at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation (please see par. <strong>‘Your Rights’</strong> below).
Where we process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which we collected it initially (and we rely on a legal basis other than consent or complying with legal obligations for this new purpose), we will ascertain whether processing for this new purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data were initially collected. More information on this assessment is available upon request (please see par. <strong>‘Your Rights’</strong> below).

<strong>5. Information sharing</strong>
We may share personal data that we collect (as set forth under paragraph 1 <strong>“What information do we collect?”</strong>) in order to provide and improve our services related to the Software and the Software with our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates which are related to the Software. These third parties are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal data confidential and may only use information about you to perform services on our behalf that are related to the Software, except to the extent that they are required to do so by law or in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. All such third parties will be required to adequately safeguard your personal data, subject to agreements that correspond to the requirements of applicable laws.

In addition to the disclosures for the purposes identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose information about you:
&bull;	to the extent that we are required to do so by law;
&bull;	in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
&bull;	in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; and
&bull;	to the purchaser or seller (or prospective purchaser or seller) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling or purchasing.

We do not intend to sell, share or rent your information to third parties.

<strong>6. Security of your personal data and data retention</strong>
We have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized use, unauthorized access and wrongful modifications, loss or destruction. Where you have chosen a password or PIN code for access to the Software, you are responsible for keeping these credentials confidential and safe (we don’t have access to these data and would not be able to help you restore PIN code or password). We ask you not to share your credentials with anyone.
Your personal data will be stored no longer than is necessary for the purpose they were obtained for, our compliance with legal and fiscal obligations, or for solving any disputes but not longer than 6 (six) years.

<strong>7. International data transfers</strong>
The processed data may be accessed by trusted third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area, including Canada, USA, Ukraine, Georgia, for the purposes mentioned above. We will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under applicable data protection law and regulations. These transfers of data outside the European Economic Area shall only occur on the basis of a legally recognized transfer mechanism, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses &quot;(EU-)controller to (non-EU/EEA-) processor&quot; <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/files/clauses_for_personal_data_transfer_processors_c2010-593.doc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decision 2010/87/EU</a> (see Article 46 of GDPR). <a href="https://projectmoore.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact</a> us to obtain a copy.
The European Commission has determined that certain countries outside the European Union offer an adequate level of data protection (see Article 45 of GDPR). You can find an overview of these countries <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

<strong>8. Your Rights</strong>
Providing the required data (IP and Lightning ID) is necessary for you to use some features of the Software. If you do not wish to provide the required data, you may not be able to use some functions of the Software (i.e., recurring/stream payments). When you use the Software, and provide the data, you can contact us (please see paragraph 11 below) to exercise any of the rights you are granted under applicable data protection laws, which includes (1) the right to access your data, (2) to rectify them, (3) to erase them, (4) to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to receiving a file of your personal data and (6) or the right to object to the processing, and where we have asked for your consent, to withdraw this consent (consent can be withdrawn anytime from the in-app Profile screen by setting Standard mode). These rights may be limited in some situations. We may, for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided by you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract.
When you would like to exercise your rights, please send your request to the contact details in Paragraph 11 below. Please note that we may need you to provide additional information to confirm your identity. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority or the supervisory authority in the EU member state of your permanent residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of your rights regarding your personal data.

<u>1. Right to access</u>
You may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if so, receive access to that data in the form of a copy. When complying with an access request, we will also provide you with additional information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned as well as any other information necessary for you to exercise the essence of this right.

<u>2. Right to rectification</u>
You have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or incompleteness. Upon request, we correct inaccurate personal data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.

<u>3. Right to erasure</u>
You also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the deletion of your data by us and, where possible, any other controller to whom your data has previously been made public by us. Erasure of your personal data only finds place in certain cases, prescribed by law and listed under article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for which they were processed as well as situations where they were processed unlawfully. Due to the way we maintain certain services, it may take some time before backup copies are erased.

<u>4. Right to restriction of processing</u>
You have the right to obtain the restriction of the processing of your personal data, which means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was contested but some time is needed for us to verify their accuracy. This right does not prevent us from continue storing your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.

<u>5. Right to receive a file (data portability)</u>
Your right to data portability entails that you may request us to provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly to another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where this is technically feasible, we transmit your personal data directly to the other controller.

<u>6. Right to object</u>
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which means you may request us to no longer process your personal data. This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’ ground constitutes the legal basis for processing (see par. ‘Legal basis’ above).
At any time and free of charge you can object to direct marketing communications. This applies in case your personal data are processed for such purpose, which also includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purpose.

<strong>9. Changes to Privacy Policy</strong>
We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on this page and, at our discretion, provided to you via the Software.
