<strong>2. General Provisions</strong>
<strong>The Lightning Network</strong> is a "second layer" payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin blockchain. It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It provides a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds and minimizing trust of third parties.
Peach Wallet is a free mobile Lightning Network Wallet. It allows you to store Bitcoin and simplifies the process of making micro payments.
Please be aware that Development of the Peach Wallet is still in progress. It means that different issues can occur during wallet usage. Using real coins may be risky and may lead to loss of funds. Lightning protocol is still in beta stage, so there may be bugs present that may lead to loss of funds or other bad user experience. We may not be liable for such occurrence under section 11 of the Terms and Conditions.

<strong>The Peach Wallet supports the following features:</strong>
•    Sending and receiving payments within the Lightning Network using payment request;
•    Sending and receiving payments on-chain. Regular transactions within Bitcoin blockchain;
•    Save and review transaction history. Details on payments that are sent and received with your wallet account are kept in history section, so you always have access to them;
•    Payment request. You can generate invoice and send it to another person to pay you according to provided payment request;
•    Custom channel opening. You can create custom channel by specifying Lightning ID and host IP of a peer; and
•    Address book. With the help of address book, you can specify clear and convenient contact names, which is useful as later you can select them on the Lightning Payment page.

<strong>Features that are allowed only between Peach users:</strong>
•    Sending and receiving payments within the Lightning Network using Lightning ID; and
